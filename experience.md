    - Managed the Electrical Engineering department’s servers, which handle file storage (AFS), user authentication (Kerberos), user authorization (LDAP), DHCP/DNS (dnsmasq), and GPU clustering (SLURM) for the department
    - Implemented new network structure that enables: (1) floor router (pfSense) to assign static public IPv4 addresses and dynamic private IPv4 addresses to connected devices; (2) link aggregation to increase bandwidth and allow fail-over between servers; and (3) two points of failure to increase uptime for services running on the servers
    - Migrated services such as NGINX reverse proxy, Jupyter notebook, and dnsmasq from virtual machines to docker containers, reducing the amount of resources that were divided by virtualization
