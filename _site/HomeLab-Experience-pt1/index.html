Boom!</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-11-05-HomeLab-Experience%5Bpt1%5D/smort.jpg" alt="smort"></p> <p>Now the tiny issue that I ran into was that I went from project one to project two and got bored of project two, I would move onto project three… and then onto project four… and then onto project five… So yeah, that really didn’t work out for me aha</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-11-05-HomeLab-Experience%5Bpt1%5D/soundsgooddoesntwork.jpeg" alt="soundsgood"></p> <p>Anyhow, here we are so let’s get started!</p> <hr> <h1 id="whats-a-homelab">What’s a HomeLab????</h1> <p>Well from my perspective, there are different spins on how people approach their own homelab set up.</p> <ul> <li> <p>On one hand, some people host services to provide a way of securing and maintaining their own data instead of having their data on a third-party server.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the another hand, some people use it to torture themselves by testing and playing with different types of hardware and software solutions while having little-to-no impact on anything ‘major’ (i.e. on a company server).</p> </li> </ul> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-11-05-HomeLab-Experience%5Bpt1%5D/linuxisfree.jpg" alt="linuxisfree"></p> <ul> <li>Now some people will use both hands by setting up and using their homelabs for both purposes as stated before, which is my ultimate goal.</li> </ul> <hr> <h1 id="okay-so-whats-your-set-up-like">Okay, so what’s your set up like?</h1> <p>That’s a very good question that I don’t even have an answer to yet. This is mostly because I’m trying to reconfigure my home network by separating my ‘homelab network’ from my ‘rest-of-the-house’ network. By doing so, whenever I need to make some network configurations to my homelab network, it won’t affect the network stability for the rest of my family.</p> <hr> <h1 id="alright-then-what-about-hardware">Alright, then what about hardware?</h1> <p>Oh this I can answer with some confidence! I have:</p> <ul> <li>3 Dell PowerEdge Servers <ul> <li>PowerEdge R320</li> <li>PowerEdge R510</li> <li>PowerEdge R710</li> </ul> </li> <li>1 Custom Built Virtualization Server</li> <li>Bunch of small computers</li> </ul> <p>I’m too lazy to pull out the specs for each server so I won’t. For the three PowerEdge servers, I bought them in 2019 (so about a year ago) on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a> using a very dangerous and tempting website called <a href="https://www.labgopher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LabGopher</a>. For the custom built virtualization server, I bought the components also from <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a>; I will probably create a separate post that talks more about the virtualization server and the components I bought. For the bunch of small computers, my dad used to administer the TOEFL exam so we have a bunch of small computers that I now use for my homelab:) They’re good enough to do some lightwork server stuff.</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-11-05-HomeLab-Experience%5Bpt1%5D/custombuild.jpg" alt="custombuild"></p> <hr> <h1 id="so-now-what">So now what?</h1> <p>Alright so here’s the situation: I own two domains (hson.dev, sonbyj01.xyz) that currently don’t have much functionality. That’s because most of my services haven’t been configured yet so I can’t reverse proxy those domains to the proper services quite yet.</p> <p>As of now, I have a general idea of how I want to configure my network:</p> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-11-05-HomeLab-Experience%5Bpt1%5D/netdiagram.jpg" alt="netdiagram"></p> <p>Now despite the saying ‘A picture is worth a thousand words,’ you probably don’t know what’s going on here and moreover why I have this particular set up in mind.</p> <p>So as I’ve mentioned before, I wanted to separate my home network into two parts, sort of like an onion. The ‘first’ layer is in white and that’s from the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAT</a>-ing that my Asus router does. All the access points, computers, laptops, phones, etc. in the house, for the most part, will connect to this ‘layer’ of the network. <u>From here-on-out, I will call this layer 'NAT-1'.</u> Now there is a second layer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NAT</a>-ing that occurs, and pfSense will handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LAN</a> network traffic that’s represented in mint green. <u>From here-on-out, I will call this layer 'NAT-2'.<u></u></u></p> <p><strong><em>My homelab will essentially live in that second ‘layer’, where it’s colored in mint green.</em></strong></p> <p>Now looking back at the diagram, you can clearly see that I have put two of my small computers on NAT-1, keller and balboa (please excuse my handwriting). Keller, which is running <a href="https://www.centos.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CentOS 7</a>, has the <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> engine running and will be hosting my very important <a href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft server container</a> because I want to still be able to play <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft</a> despite my entire homelab being offline. Balboa, which is running <a href="https://www.debian.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debian 10</a>, also has the <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a> engine running but instead will be hosting the <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-unifi-controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UniFi Controller container</a> for my access points.</p> <p>Moving onto NAT-2, this is where the fun stuff begins and ends… Mostly because I have’t figured out how I want to approach it… Just off the top of my head, I know I want to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_aggregation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link aggregation</a> to work so I can increase the bandwidth between servers, but right now I can’t even access the <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pfSense</a> UI so I have to first figure that out before I even move on. Once I can access the UI for my router, then I will most likely set it as my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DMZ</a> host from my Asus router.</p> <p>So, in all, as of now, none of my services are up and running, but I hope that during winter break I can spend more time with my servers so I can actually properly set them up.</p> <p>Tentatively, I have a couple of services that I want to get up and running once I figure out my entire network situation.</p> <ul> <li>
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/swag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SWAG</a> - to handle all my http/https requests (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reverse proxying</a>)</li> <li>
