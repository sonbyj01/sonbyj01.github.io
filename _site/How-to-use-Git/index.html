What are you going to do? You could ‘quickly’ open up a Firefox tab, type ‘drive.google.com’, locate your program, and then drag-and-drop it into Google Drive.</p> <p>Or let’s saying you’re building the next ‘Google’ website because you have trust issues, but you also know you can’t do this alone. How are you and your buddy Gabriel Weinberg going to work on the same code at the same time?</p> <p>Oh boy, do I have the perfect candidate for you:</p> <p>Introducing… Git!</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/git_logo.gif" alt="GitLogo"></p> <hr> <h1 id="so-what-is-git">So what is git?</h1> <p>Well if you want the textbook definition, here it is:</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <p>If none of what was said right before this made sense, just key into these specific parts: <em>coordinating work among programmers</em>, <em>track changes in any set of files</em>, <em>speed</em>.</p> <h1 id="okay-then-what-about-git-commands-whats-that">Okay, then what about git commands? What’s that?</h1> <p>Git commands are essentially that: they’re just commands for git. You can <del>Google</del> DuckDuckGo search these commands but at least for me, most of them didn’t make sense unless I saw them being applied. So, that’s exactly what I will be doing!</p> <h1 id="setting-up-our-workstation">Setting up our workstation</h1> <p>So before we dive into creating repositories and adding some code, let’s first download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS Code</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a> (I recommend installing VS Code first before Git). Git is the application that will be driving this entire tutorial while VS Code is a nice, modern editor that we will use to add and edit code. <strong>Note: When installing Git, if you installed VS Code first, you will then be prompted to choose which text editor you want to use during setup. Make sure you choose VS Code!</strong></p> <h1 id="how-to-set-up-github">How to set up Github</h1> <h2 id="setting-up-an-account">Setting up an account</h2> <p>So more often that not, unless you’re hosting your own Gitlab server <a href="https://git.sonbyj01.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like me</a>, you’re best bet is to use <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github.com</a>. It’s free and a lot of people use it!</p> <hr> <h1 id="so-where-can-i-use-git-then">So where can I use git then?</h1> <p>Well there are some platforms that are readily available for you to use git with, such as Gitlab and Github.</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/gitlab.jpg" alt="GitlabLogo"></p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/github.png" alt="GithubLogo"></p> <hr> <h3 id="create-an-account">Create an account</h3> <p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github.com</a> and click “Sign up”. Fill in each box with its respective information. Remember: the username you pick now will stick with you forever… and ever…</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/signup.PNG" alt="Signup"></p> <hr> <p>You’ll then be prompted to answer some questions on why you joined Github, afterwhich you’ll then be sent a verification email to the address you gave it before. Once you verify your email, you’ll be greeted with this page:</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/github_main.PNG" alt="Github_main"></p> <hr> <p>You have successfully created an account!</p> <hr> <h3 id="setting-up-your-desktoplaptop">Setting up your desktop/laptop</h3> <p>Now the following instructions are for users on Windows. These steps should be fairly similar to those users on Linux and Mac however.</p> <p>Okay so now that we’ve created a Github account, we need something else for our computer to communicate with Github, and that’s where <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a> comes into play. Now technically speaking, git is already installed on your computer but (hopefully) you’ll see why I like this slightly more. Go ahead and install <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a> onto your computer. After you go through the installation and all, you should have ‘Git Bash’ when you search for it; open it.</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/gitbash.PNG" alt="gitbash"></p> <hr> <p>Now, the beautiful thing about installing from <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Git</a> is that it also installs something called <a href="http://mingw.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“MinGW”</a>. This will essentially give you a ‘Unix’ feeling, as in most of the basic commands you type in here will also apply to Linux and Mac. Now let’s start syncing Github with your computer! Type in the following commands. <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you don’t want to set up SSH with your Github account, you can skip all the instructions regarding SSH. You will instead clone your repository using HTTPS.</p> <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"H Son"</span>       <span class="c"># replace "H Son" with your name</span>

You finally synced your computer and Github!

<a href="https://www.makeareadme.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">README</a> - this is essentially a way for you to articulate the purpose and how-to-use documentation for your repository</li> <li>
<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.gitignore</a> - this is a file that is inside your repository and in it contains a list of certain files or folders that should <strong>NOT</strong> be uploaded to Github when pushing (i.e. virtual environments, IDE preferences, etc.)</li> <li>
<a href="https://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">license</a> - there are different types of licenses that you can apply to your repository, the more common ones being MIT License and GNU General Public License v3.0.</li> </ul> <p>Once you’ve created your repository, you’ll be redirected to that repository’s page.</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/repo.PNG" alt="repo"></p> <hr> <p>Click on “Clone or download”, make sure it says “Clone with SSH”, and click the copy button icon right next to the URL. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, you can alternatively use HTTPS. When you push later on, you will instead just type in your Github account information.</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/clone.PNG" alt="clone"></p> <hr> <p>Then head back to your MINGW terminal.

You’ve made your first push!</p> <p>To check it out, go back to your repository page.

Essentially how Github is structured is that there is a ‘master’ branch that should be working and have the final iteration of changes. It’s the ‘master’ branch for a reason… Now if you want to make some edits to your code, you would branch off of the master and make edits there. That’s what we did before when we did ‘git checkout -b branch1’. Now, if you’re happy with the edits and changes you’ve made to your code, you can then ‘merge’ your branch and the master branch, leaving the master branch updated with content from said branch. This is what the “Compare &amp; pull request” is allowing you to do.</p> <p>So, click on “Compare &amp; pull request”</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/compare_pull1.PNG" alt="compare_pull1"></p> <hr> <p>In this upper section, you can see the commit message that you wrote previously when pushing. If you’re happy with the edits, click “Create pull request” &gt; then “Merge pull request” &gt; then “Confirm merge”. If you scroll down further, you can also see the specific changes that will be made to your files in the master branch.</p> <hr> <p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/compare_pull2.PNG" alt="compare_pull2"></p> <hr> <p>If you also want, on the right side, there’s an option to pick either ‘Unified’ or ‘Split’.
