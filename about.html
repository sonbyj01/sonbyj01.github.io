    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello,<br>I am currently a sophomore electrical and computer engineering student at 
        the <a href="http://cooper.edu/welcome">Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art</a>. I'm
        hoping to consistenly maintain this blog as a way for me to document the small work/projects I am 
        currently working on. However, I am somewhat forgetful so let's see how far this goes... Hope you enjoy though:)
