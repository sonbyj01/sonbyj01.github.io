description: Myers-Briggs Personality Test
---
Hello,

So in my previous life (high school), I was a personality test fanatic. I would literally search up "different personality tests" and found a webpage full of them 
(I would link the page but I tried probing through my bookmarks and I couldn't find it... However there is a different link that I found here: [Personality tests]). 
In any case, I thought it would be interesting to take the [Myers-Briggs Type Indicator] questionnaire, or more commonly known as the [16 Personalities Test]. With
it, I will be going through each question from the website and try my best to explain my reasoning. Hopefully this will interesting and give you a bit of an insight 
on me as a person. 

"You enjoy vibrant social events with lots of people."
ooo oo o | x xx xxx

o: It would depend on what "lots of people" mean. Don't get me wrong, I love enjoying time with people, especially with friends and all, but sometimes I feel like
I'm the odd man out. It's a weird thing of mine that I haven't been able to rub off. One video that strikes my mind when I think of these situations is this video
by [Kurzgesagt on Loneliness]. I completely recommend you watching this video you haven't done so.

-----

"You often spend time exploring unrealistic yet intriguing ideas."

x: Like before, there's some ambiguity to this question. What's "unrealistic"? I mean sometime in the future, I want to build my own house from scratch and I plan
on dedicating some part of my life to building a private boarding school as well. It's not 'unrealistic' because it has been done countless times. Nonetheless, I 
can't do much about it now because I can't financially support the building of a house or a private boarding school so...

-----

"Your travel plans are more likely to look like a rough list of ideas than a detailed itinerary."

oo: The way I like to plan my trips is by first figuring out all the definitive time/dates (i.e. when is the flight, when do I have to check in, etc.). Then, I look
at some activities to do in that general area and figure out which activities run at certain time/dates. After I figure all those hard times/dates, then I'm whatever
about what we do ahaha.

-----

"You often think about what you should have said in a conversation long after it has taken place."

ooo: You have no idea. There are countless times when I would be showering in the morning and/or at night, and I would be standing underneath the warm water just 
thinking back to this one conversation that I had with someone. If there was something I wanted to say and I didn't, I would get upset at myself for not saying it,
and if there was something that I said and it rubbed on the person the wrong way, I would think of better ways of approaching the situation. There goes all that water...

-----

"If your friend is sad about something, your first instinct is to support them emotionally, not try to solve their problem."

x: I've had a conversation with a close friend about this. I don't know why but it's really difficult for me to be sympathetic/empathetic, and when there are situations
I want to showcase that sympathy/empathy, I don't know what to say or do. On another note, I'm also just the type of person to look for solutions when someone asks me 
about (personal) problems rather than comforting and being there for said person...

-----

"People can rarely upset you."

xx: Well, I think it depends on what type of mood I'm in. However, more often than not, people can and do easily get underneath my skin and it's an issue. But, I do my 
best not to show it publicaly. In other situations, people also just disappoint me, which is why I disagree with the statement slightly more. Yeah sure, don't have 
expectations blah blah blah, you can think that but I try my best to give people the benefit of the doubt and I have expectations (which I don't vocalize to them) 
because I expect a certain amount of effort from those people. I would feel worse about myself if people didn't have any expectations or even low expectations of me. 
But maybe that's just me.

-----

"You often rely on other people to be the ones to start a conversation and keep it going."

o: I cannot single handedly carry out a conversation... Because then it wouldn't be a conversation... 

-----

"If you have to temporarily put your plans on hold, you make sure it is your top priority to get back on track as soon as possible."

oo: There's not much to be said about this one. I will say that my top priority may not be the most "important" priority... *cough cough servers cough cough

-----

"You rarely worry if you made a good impression on someone you met."

xxx: I don't know about you but I think first impressions are very important. They're obviously not the 'end-all, be-all' but making a good first impression will 
only work in your favor. I know after I meet an interviewer or a friend of a friend I get super nervous and anxious afterwards, and then this goes back to the 
previous statement of whether I look back at a conversation after it's been held. 

-----

"It would be a challenge for you to spend the whole weekend all by yourself without feeling bored."

xxx: Honestly, that's what I've been doing for the past couple of weeks. #coronavirus? But in all honesty, I never thought it would be a challenge because there's
so much that I want to learn so I would definitely find a way to keep myself busy. 

-----

"You are more of a detail-oriented than a big picture person."

x: I honestly couldn't tell you which type of person I am... I mean, as someone who studies computer science and programming, having both qualities are essential. 
However, I think more recently, whenever I code, I try to think more about scalability and compatibility while also looking out towards the long term. If that made
any sense.

-----

"You are very affectionate with people you care about."

o: I think I am very affectionate with people I care about... But it's definitely scaled down from before. 

-----

"You have a careful and methodical approach to life."

oo: From the way I've grown up, planning for the future has been one of the many lesson I've learned, which is why I always try my best to plan things ahead of time.

-----

"You are still bothered by the mistakes you made a long time ago."

ooo: I can't help it. I'm not very forgiving to myself. But I am very forgiving to others!

-----

"At parties and similar events you can mostly be found farther away from the action."

oo: Yeah, not that I've been to a lot of parties and similar events, but I do tend to crawl my way towards the outside. 

-----

"You often find it difficult to relate to people who let their emotions guide them."

o: I don't think I have a difficult time relating to people who let their emotions guide them... ? But I do resort to some logical sequence of steps so I can 
clearly try to understand how the other person is feeling because I won't obviously understand how they are feeling subjectively.

-----

"When looking for a movie to watch, you can spend ages browsing the catalog."

oo: Yeah, I'm picky when it comes to movies to watch for some odd reason. 

-----

"You can stay calm under a lot of pressure." 

oo: You see, the key word is "can"! If I really wanted to, I can stay calm. But that's no fun! Also, learning to stay calm under pressure is the reason why 
I haven't bombed most of my tests in the past couple of years. Key word in that sentence being "most"...

-----

"When in a group of people you do not know, you have no problem jumping right into their conversation."

x: If they're talking about something I know, then not really. However, I don't like intruding into groups to begin with, especially if I don't know them. 

-----

"When you sleep, your dreams tend to be bizarre and fantastical."

xx: Not really, they're usually down-to-earth. 

-----

"In your opinion, it is sometimes OK to step on others to get ahead in life." 

x: It depends on what you mean by 'to step on others'. I don't think it's okay to step on others to get ahead in life. Do I still do it? Well, like I said before, 
it depends on what you mean by 'to step on others'.

-----

"You are dedicated and focused on your goals, only rarely getting sidetracked."

xx: Absolutely false. I love getting sidetracked because it means I'm learning more and branching further out than what I intended on doing. 

-----

"If you make a mistake, you tend to start doubting yourself, your abilities, or your knowledge."

ooo: No comment...

-----

"When at a social event, you rarely try to introduce yourself to new people and mostly talk to the ones you already know."

o: Yeah, it's true. I mean, I've been trying more recently to not resort to the people I already know. 

-----

"You usually lose interest in a discussion when it gets philosophical."

xxx: Quite the opposite actually. 

-----

"You would never let yourself cry in front of others."

xx: I wouldn't but have I? Yes.

-----

"You feel more drawn to places with a bustling and busy atmosphere than to more quiet and intimate ones. " 

x: I like a busy atmosphere when I'm outside and a quiet atmosphere when I'm inside (so I can play my music peacefully). 

-----

"You like discussing different views and theories on what the world could look like in the future."

ooo: I honestly don't know how you don't find this fun. 

-----

"When it comes to making life-changing choices, you mostly listen to your heart rather than your head."

o: Every decision you make is a life-changing choice. One way I gauge my decision is by looking into the future and seeing if I would regret
not going forth with the decision. 

-----

"You cannot imagine yourself dedicating your life to the study of something that you cannot see, touch, or experience."

ooo: Yeah I can't. That's why I love engineering and tinkering. 

-----

"You usually prefer to get your revenge rather than forgive."

xx: Revenge is messy and takes so much energy. 

-----

"You often make decisions on a whim."

oo: I think about it very quickly, determining some possible outcomes, and then make a decision. 

-----

"The time you spend by yourself often ends up being more interesting and satisfying than the time you spend with other people."

x: I like enjoying and spending time with other people. There's no way I'm going to karaoke by myself.

-----

"You often put special effort into interpreting the real meaning or the message of a song or a movie."

x: Not really. I just interpret the meaning one way and leave it at that. Occasionally, I will look up the actual meaning of a song
and then move forward with it. 

-----

"You always know exactly what you want."

xx: Not true. I don't 'always' know what I want.

-----

"You rarely think back on the choices you made and wonder what you could have done differently."

xxx: Psh, I would not be Henry if I did not look back on my choices and wondered if I could have done things differently.

-----

"When in a public place, you usually stick to quieter and less crowded areas. "

o:

"You tend to focus on present realities rather than future possibilities. "

x:

"You often have a hard time understanding other people’s feelings. "

o:

"When starting to work on a project, you prefer to make as many decisions upfront as possible. "

oo:

"When you know someone thinks highly of you, you also wonder how long it will be until they become disappointed in you. "

ooo:

"You feel comfortable just walking up to someone you find interesting and striking up a conversation. "

o:

"You often drift away into daydreaming about various ideas or scenarios. "

oo:

"You look after yourself first, and others come in second. "

o:

"Even when you have planned a particular daily routine, you usually just end up doing what you feel like at any given moment. "

o:

"Your mood can change very quickly. "

ooo:

"You often contemplate the reasons for human existence or the meaning of life. "

ooo:

"You often talk about your own feelings and emotions. "

xx:

"You have got detailed education or career development plans stretching several years into the future. "

o: 

"You rarely dwell on your regrets. "

xxx:

"Spending time in a dynamic atmosphere with lots of people around quickly makes you feel drained and in need of a getaway. "

o:

"You see yourself as more of a realist than a visionary. "

o:

"You find it easy to empathize with a person who has gone through something you never have. "

o:

"Your personal work style is closer to spontaneous bursts of energy than to organized and consistent efforts. "

ooo:

"Your emotions control you more than you control them. "

o:

"After a long and exhausting week, a fun party is just what you need. "

o:

"You frequently find yourself wondering how technological advancement could change everyday life. "

oo:

"You always consider how your actions might affect other people before doing something. "

o:

"You still honor the commitments you have made even if you have a change of heart. "

o:

"You rarely feel insecure. "
