<p>So youâ€™re sitting at your computer, working on some intense Tic-Tac-Toe code, when all of a sudden the building youâ€™re working on is on fire! What are you going to do? You could â€˜quicklyâ€™ open up a Firefox tab, type â€˜drive.google.comâ€™, locate your program, and then drag-and-drop it into Google Drive.</p>

<p>Or letâ€™s saying youâ€™re building the next â€˜Googleâ€™ website because you have trust issues, but you also know you canâ€™t do this alone. How are you and your buddy Gabriel Weinberg going to work on the same code at the same time?</p>

<p>Oh boy, do I have the perfect candidate for you:</p>

<p>Introducingâ€¦ Git!</p>

<h1 id="so-what-is-git">So what is git?</h1>
<p>Well if you want the textbook definition, here it is:</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>If none of what was said right before this made sense, just key into these specific parts: <em>coordinating work among programmers</em>, <em>track changes in any set of files</em>, <em>speed</em>.</p>

<h1 id="okay-then-what-about-git-commands-whats-that">Okay, then what about git commands? Whatâ€™s that?</h1>
<p>Git commands are essentially that: theyâ€™re just commands for git. You can <del>Google</del> DuckDuckGo search these commands but at least for me, most of them didnâ€™t make sense unless I saw them being applied. So, thatâ€™s exactly what I will be doing!</p>

<h1 id="setting-up-our-workstation">Setting up our workstation</h1>
<p>So before we dive into creating repositories and adding some code, letâ€™s first download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> (I recommend installing VS Code first before Git). Git is the application that will be driving this entire tutorial while VS Code is a nice, modern editor that we will use to add and edit code. <strong>Note: When installing Git, if you installed VS Code first, you will then be prompted to choose which text editor you want to use during setup. Make sure you choose VS Code!</strong></p>

<h1 id="how-to-set-up-github">How to set up Github</h1>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-account">Setting up an account</h2>
<p>So more often that not, unless youâ€™re hosting your own Gitlab server <a href="https://git.sonbyj01.xyz/">like me</a>, youâ€™re best bet is to use <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a>. Itâ€™s free and a lot of people use it!</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="so-where-can-i-use-git-then">So where can I use git then?</h1>
<p>Well there are some platforms that are readily available for you to use git with, such as Gitlab and Github.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/gitlab.jpg" alt="GitlabLogo" /></p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/github.png" alt="GithubLogo" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="create-an-account">Create an account</h3>
<p>Go to <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a> and click â€œSign upâ€. Fill in each box with its respective information. Remember: the username you pick now will stick with you foreverâ€¦ and everâ€¦</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/signup.PNG" alt="Signup" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Youâ€™ll then be prompted to answer some questions on why you joined Github, afterwhich youâ€™ll then be sent a verification email to the address you gave it before. Once you verify your email, youâ€™ll be greeted with this page:</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/github_main.PNG" alt="Github_main" /></p>

<hr />

<p>You have successfully created an account!</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="setting-up-your-desktoplaptop">Setting up your desktop/laptop</h3>
<p>Now the following instructions are for users on Windows. These steps should be fairly similar to those users on Linux and Mac however.</p>

<p>Okay so now that weâ€™ve created a Github account, we need something else for our computer to communicate with Github, and thatâ€™s where <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> comes into play. Now technically speaking, git is already installed on your computer but (hopefully) youâ€™ll see why I like this slightly more. Go ahead and install <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> onto your computer. After you go through the installation and all, you should have â€˜Git Bashâ€™ when you search for it; open it.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/gitbash.PNG" alt="gitbash" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Now, the beautiful thing about installing from <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is that it also installs something called <a href="http://mingw.org/">â€œMinGWâ€</a>. This will essentially give you a â€˜Unixâ€™ feeling, as in most of the basic commands you type in here will also apply to Linux and Mac. Now letâ€™s start syncing Github with your computer! Type in the following commands. <strong>NOTE:</strong> if you donâ€™t want to set up SSH with your Github account, you can skip all the instructions regarding SSH. You will instead clone your repository using HTTPS.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"H Son"</span>       <span class="c"># replace "H Son" with your name</span>
git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email <span class="s2">"testing.sonbyj01@gmail.com"</span>     <span class="c"># replace "testing.sonbyj01@gmail.com" with your email</span>
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-C</span> <span class="s2">"testing.sonbyj01@gmail.com"</span> <span class="nt">-t</span> rsa       <span class="c"># replace "testing.sonbyj01@gmail.com" with your email</span>
<span class="c"># just click enter for each prompt when doing the 'ssh-keygen'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/global_sshkeygen.PNG" alt="keygen" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Then type in the following command and copy the output.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cat</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/sshkey.PNG" alt="sshkey" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Then go back to <a href="https://github.com/">Github.com</a>. Click on your profile picture, click â€œSettingsâ€ &gt; â€œSSH and GPG keysâ€ &gt; â€œNew SSH keyâ€.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/settings.PNG" alt="settings" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Paste the long string that you copied before and add a name to that key.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/addingssh.PNG" alt="addingssh" /></p>

<hr />

<p>After you save the ssh key, your â€œSSH and GPG keysâ€ page should look something like this.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/new_settings.PNG" alt="new_settings" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Woo! You finally synced your computer and Github! If youâ€™re still having issues, refer to this page on <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh">connecting to Github with SSH</a>.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="how-to-use-github">How to use Github</h1>
<hr />
<h3 id="creating-your-first-repository">Creating your first repository</h3>
<p>Now itâ€™s time to create your first repository! <em>I recommend making a repository on Github and then cloning that to your desktop.</em></p>

<p>Click on your profile picture &gt; â€œYour repositoriesâ€ &gt; â€œNewâ€. You should be on a page similar to this then.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/create_repo.PNG" alt="create_repo" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Add a repository name: this will be the name of your â€˜projectâ€™. You can then either choose â€˜Publicâ€™ or â€˜Privateâ€™, initialize a â€˜READMEâ€™, add â€˜.gitignoreâ€™, and add a â€˜licenseâ€™.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.makeareadme.com/">README</a> - this is essentially a way for you to articulate the purpose and how-to-use documentation for your repository</li>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">.gitignore</a> - this is a file that is inside your repository and in it contains a list of certain files or folders that should <strong>NOT</strong> be uploaded to Github when pushing (i.e. virtual environments, IDE preferences, etc.)</li>
  <li><a href="https://choosealicense.com/">license</a> - there are different types of licenses that you can apply to your repository, the more common ones being MIT License and GNU General Public License v3.0.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once youâ€™ve created your repository, youâ€™ll be redirected to that repositoryâ€™s page.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/repo.PNG" alt="repo" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Click on â€œClone or downloadâ€, make sure it says â€œClone with SSHâ€, and click the copy button icon right next to the URL. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, you can alternatively use HTTPS. When you push later on, you will instead just type in your Github account information.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/clone.PNG" alt="clone" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Then head back to your MINGW terminal. Now a bit of a side node but here are some <a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/101-bash-commands-and-tips-for-beginners-to-experts-30je#pwd-ls-cd">â€˜bash commandsâ€™</a> you can use to navigate your way around the terminal.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/bash.PNG" alt="bash" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Now Iâ€™m going to clone my repository onto my Desktop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git clone &lt;repository url (the link you copied before this)&gt; - create a copy of your Github repository to your current location</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>Desktop
git clone git@github.com:t35t-4cc0unt/Hello-World.git <span class="c"># this is for SSH cloning</span>
git clone https://github.com/t35t-4cc0unt/Hello-World.git <span class="c"># this is for HTTPS cloning</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/cloning_desktop.PNG" alt="cloning_desktop" /></p>

<hr />

<p>If you check on your terminal, you should see your repository name. In my case, itâ€™s â€˜Hello-Worldâ€™.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/successful_clone.PNG" alt="cloning_desktop" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Now enter your repository folder using cd and then open the repository using a code editor (I will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>). If you havenâ€™t done so already, download the <em>free</em> program.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>Hello-World/
code <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/opening_repo.PNG" alt="opening_code" /></p>

<hr />

<p>If you have VS Code installed, it should have opened with your repository. Now letâ€™s doing something pretty simple. Iâ€™m going to edit the README.md file and add a small program to this folder. Once I have done that, I will be updating my repository using terminal again. (Note: you can technically do it from VS code, but Iâ€™m not going over that right now.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>git checkout -b &lt;new_branch&gt; - create a new â€˜branchâ€™ on your repository (good practice!) more information on <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging">branches</a></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>git add &lt;file/folder(s)&gt; - add file/folder(s) that will be pushed to Github (you can also use * to specify all folders and files in that current directory)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>git reset &lt;file/folder(s)&gt; - â€˜resetsâ€™ the folders and files that youâ€™ve added; leave blank to undo all â€˜addsâ€™ youâ€™ve made</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>git commit -m '&lt;message&gt;' - add a message to Github that should describe the changes youâ€™ve made to the file/folder(s)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>git push origin &lt;new_branch&gt; - push the file/folder(s) you added before from your local git repository (origin) to the remote repository â€˜new_branchâ€™</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout <span class="nt">-b</span> <span class="s1">'branch1'</span>
git add <span class="k">*</span>
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"added HelloWorld program and updated README.md"</span>
git push origin branch1
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/push_new.PNG" alt="push_new" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Woo! Congratulations! Youâ€™ve made your first push!</p>

<p>To check it out, go back to your repository page. Click on where it says â€œBranch: masterâ€ (right next to â€œNew pull requestâ€) and click on the branch you pushed to.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/view_branch1.PNG" alt="view_branch1" /></p>

<hr />

<p>And boom, there are the changes youâ€™ve made!</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/done_branch1.PNG" alt="done_branch1" /></p>

<hr />

<h3 id="manage-pull-requests">Manage Pull requests</h3>
<p>Now notice how thereâ€™s a yellow, long box and at the end thereâ€™s a green box labeled â€œCompare &amp; pull requestâ€. Essentially how Github is structured is that there is a â€˜masterâ€™ branch that should be working and have the final iteration of changes. Itâ€™s the â€˜masterâ€™ branch for a reasonâ€¦ Now if you want to make some edits to your code, you would branch off of the master and make edits there. Thatâ€™s what we did before when we did â€˜git checkout -b branch1â€™. Now, if youâ€™re happy with the edits and changes youâ€™ve made to your code, you can then â€˜mergeâ€™ your branch and the master branch, leaving the master branch updated with content from said branch. This is what the â€œCompare &amp; pull requestâ€ is allowing you to do.</p>

<p>So, click on â€œCompare &amp; pull requestâ€</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/compare_pull1.PNG" alt="compare_pull1" /></p>

<hr />

<p>In this upper section, you can see the commit message that you wrote previously when pushing. If youâ€™re happy with the edits, click â€œCreate pull requestâ€ &gt; then â€œMerge pull requestâ€ &gt; then â€œConfirm mergeâ€. If you scroll down further, you can also see the specific changes that will be made to your files in the master branch.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/compare_pull2.PNG" alt="compare_pull2" /></p>

<hr />

<p>If you also want, on the right side, thereâ€™s an option to pick either â€˜Unifiedâ€™ or â€˜Splitâ€™. The split option looks like the one below.</p>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/compare_pull3.PNG" alt="compare_pull3" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Now that you completed the merge request, go back to your repository page and under the master branch you should see your file edits/changes.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="updating-your-local-repository-from-remote-repository">Updating your local repository from remote repository</h3>
<p>So you and your buddy are working on the same branch</p>

<h3 id="end-of-day-sequence">End of Day Sequence</h3>
<p>Now letâ€™s say youâ€™ve been working the entire day, just cranking out code left and right from *cough stackoverflow and your innovative mind, and itâ€™s time to pack up and head back home. Your â€˜end-of-dayâ€™ protocol should look something a little like this.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>git checkout &lt;existing_branch&gt; - switch to an existing branch</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git checkout branch1
git add <span class="k">*</span>
git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"added install script"</span>
git push origin branch1
</code></pre></div></div>

<hr />
<p><img src="/assets/images/2020-04-28-How-to_use-Git/end-of-day.PNG" alt="end-of-day" /></p>

<hr />

<p>I hope this was a resourceful guide on how to use git. And remember,</p>
